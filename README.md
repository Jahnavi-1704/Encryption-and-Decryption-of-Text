# Encryption-and-Decryption-of-Text
This involves dynamic memory allocation. It uses a 8-bit unsigned integral key which acts as a unique stream cipher. This project implements 2 functions, one  that encodes the plaintext message and converts the ciphertext to ASCII armour. The next decodes the ASCII armour back into the ciphertext and then decodes the ciphertext back into the plaintext.
